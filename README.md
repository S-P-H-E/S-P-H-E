## Hi, I’m Sphe!

I am a full-stack developer and designer.

I build with TypeScript, Rust and Go on the backend, React and Svelete on the frontend and the Elysia framework for Node/Bun APIs

For hosting, I use Vercel for most projects and Railway for Docker-based backend services and microservices.
