<h3 style="margin: 0;">Hi, I’m Sphe!</h3>

I am a full-stack developer and designer.

I build with TypeScript, Rust, and Go on the backend
and React (usually via Next.js), Vue, and the Hono framework for Node / Bun APIs.

For hosting: Vercel for most React front-ends, Docker plus Railway for backend services and full-stack projects.
